# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I created this guide as a way to document and organize what I have learned throughout the bootcamp prework. The guide will allow me to easily review my notes to solidify new topics and concepts.

Throughout this project I learned the basic fundamentals of HTML, CSS, JS, and Git.

## Usage

The page lists each topic learned throughout the prework along with any notes that I documented. You can open the DevTools console to see the JS running, which lists each topic learned and randomly selects a topic to study.
